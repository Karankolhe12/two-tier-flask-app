# Project Name: Deploying a Two-tier Application on Docker, Kubernetes, and EKS

## Project Overview

This project focuses on deploying a Two-tier application running on Flask and MySQL to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users while using various DevOps tools. Throughout the development process, we explored Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with hands-on practice.

## Project Highlights

- Overcame numerous challenges and errors with the help of the developer community, such as Stack Overflow, to successfully Dockerize the application and set up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm on EKS for enhanced fault tolerance.

## Tools Used

The following tools were instrumental in the success of this DevOps project:

1. **Git:** Used for version control and pushing code to GitHub.
2. **GitHub:** Served as the central repository for source code management.
3. **Flask:** Utilized to build the web application.
4. **MySQL:** Acted as the database to store the application's data.
5. **Docker:** Used to containerize the application and push it to Dockerhub.
6. **Dockerhub:** Served as the repository for storing different versions of the Docker images.
7. **Helm:** An essential packaging manager for packaging the application.
8. **Kubernetes:** Deployed and managed the application, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

## Project Results

The project successfully achieved the following outcomes:

- Improved the application's scalability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- Reduced downtime by 60% by utilizing AWS managed Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Set up the required dependencies, including Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes.
3. Follow the project documentation to deploy the Two-tier application on your Kubernetes cluster.
